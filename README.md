# 03_IsingMCMC.jl
- Ising Model Simulation for Various Lattice Types with Julia

# Usage
- Put the sources at the current dir, and open them in Julia like:
julia> include("IsingSimMain02a.jl")
julia> main(2,1)

- The main function takes two argments:
 - the first arg : the type of lattice (1: square, 2: hex)
 - the second arg : the temperature
